<h2> Hello! </h2>
<p> This is my portfolio site, which has been created to help show off all of
my design work so far for my Masters degree. Unfortunately, we're very early on in the course, so...
this is pretty much all the design work I have right now. But it's okay! Because I have a few other things
I could show you that might be of use too. Let's see, shall we? </p>

<h2> Writing </h2>

<p> Before I was a Digital Media Design student, I was a struggling writer trying to make it big. Emphasis on struggling.
  See here for more of my writing work, across several different websites. </p>

and comic books, and accidentlly found ourselves a creative outlet. </p>

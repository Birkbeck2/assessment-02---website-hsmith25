    <h2> A portfolio to end all portfolios </h2>
    <p>This portfolio is meant to triumphantly display all of the magnificent work I have created so far.</p>
<p>Tragically, I am yet to achieve anything of note.</p>
<p>So here, we'll just play around a bit, and understand a bit about how this site is going to work. Maybe.</p>

  <div><h3> Writing </h3>
  <p> I know my ABCs... all the way up to the squiggly one.<br> You know. The squiggly one.</p></div>
    <div><h3>Podcasting </h3>
    <p> Some people can't read, but even <em>they</em> will not be spared from my inane ramblings. </p></div>
    <div><h3> Design </h3>
      <p>I haven't done anything yet, so it just links to this site. Don't click it. </p></div>
      <div><h3> Contact Me! </h3>
        <p> ...Please? <br> I'm so lonely.</p></div>

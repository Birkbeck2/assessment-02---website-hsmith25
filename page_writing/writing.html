  <p> I have been writing in a professional setting for more than five years, primarily as a writer/journalist
    for Jungle Creations (VT.co). As well as this, I have also written for Creative Review, and other assorted websites.
  Please see below for a section of my work. It should give you a good idea of my writing style, as well as my versatility. </p>
  <p>Note: My articles from VT.co no longer have images in them, for reasons unknown to me.</p>

  <h2> How the Ministry of Stories is helping kids be creative </h2>
  <h3>For Creative Review</h3>
  <p> Tucked away in the heart of east London, Ministry of Stories is a charity that aims to encourage the artist in every child,
    through after-school clubs based in creativity and collaboration. I talked to the team behind it about how it works.</p> <p>Note: this article is behind a paywall</p>

    <h2> The Superhero Beard </h2>
    <h3>For The Beard Mag</h3>
    <p>This is the very first article I ever wrote on the internet (tragically, I did not get paid for this).
      It's an article about facial hair in action movies, which hints at Hollywood's insidious anti-beard agenda.</p>
